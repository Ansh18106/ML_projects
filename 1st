MM: What will be the Plan of Action for the upcoming spring semester? Director: We plan to start the classes for the new semester in the first week of January. We will also be giving parents an option to send their ward to campus or not because not all students are equally comfortable returning to the campus "" We are also planning to go for a hybrid mode with both online and offline processes, but the end sem exams and practicals would be conducted physically from the coming spring semester. Those who opt for the hybrid medium would be called ten days before the end sem, and they have to complete their practicals and stay ten days after the theory exams for the practical exams. Conducting the exams in the physical mode will maintain the quality of submission; otherwise, it would be a disregard to the good students. The decision on mid-semester exams for them is yet to be taken, but most probably, that would be conducted online so that they can visit the campus directly during the end semester exams. Therefore, as per the prevailing situation, we plan on this, but we have no control over how the future pans out.
